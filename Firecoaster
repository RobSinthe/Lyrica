[Verse 1]

caught in aberration
one step towars damnation
incomplete
I'm about to wear the crown

out there, there is just no one to fear
deminished from the falling
the nature´s calling

[Pre-Chorus]
one to pretend that we tend our beating heart
awaken up as one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it´s´ not unbreakable'

the time is here now
our own damnation left into the wild.
one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn
it´s not unbreakable


[Verse 2]
yeah
out here lost in fiction
lights all out upon our vision
remnants of the wild
just ride into the night

[Pre-Chorus]
so take this ride of your life on this beast to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

the time is here now
our own damnation left into the wild.
one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn
it´s not unbreakable

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

break me
shake me
left into the wild
one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn
we´re not unbreakable

Verse 1]
Through the haze, the skyline shimmers
Silver waves are bending in the heat
I’m standing where the clouds turn
From the fragments we are woven, through the silence we are drifting
And the stars are falling

[Pre-Chorus]
We will rise, we will rise, we will rise till the light is gone
im taking the ride of my life on this beast to the break of dawn

[Chorus – unchanged]
It’s time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I’ve been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning ’round and ’round as we bend the limits
Oh, it’s not unbreakable

[Post-Chorus]
Shape me, break me, carry me through storms
We will rise, we will rise, we will rise till the light is gone
It’s not unbreakable

[Verse 2]
In the glass, the night is breathing
Every sound is bending into gold
Our shadows turn to lanterns
From the echoes we are floating, through the mirrors we are shining
And the tides are calling

[Pre-Chorus]
We will rise, we will rise, we will rise till the light is gone
To awaken every dream with the spark in the dark till the light is gone

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
We will rise, we will rise, we will rise till the light is gone
To awaken every dream with the spark in the dark till the light is gone

[Chorus – unchanged]
It’s time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I’ve been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning ’round and ’round as we bend the limits
Oh, it’s not unbreakable
Oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Shape me, break me, carry me through storms


Verse 1]
One, two, the night is igniting
Bright sparks are racing out on the street
I’m stepping to the crown
One, two, we just rise, rise, rise, two, we’re climbing from the embers
And the sky is breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone
To awaken all the fire in the hearts for the fight till the light is gone

[Chorus – unchanged]
It’s time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I’ve been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning ’round and ’round as we bend the limits
Oh, it’s not unbreakable

[Post-Chorus]
Push me, chase me, drive into the storm
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone
It’s not unbreakable

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone
To awaken all the fire in the hearts for the fight till the light is gone

[Chorus – unchanged]
It’s time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I’ve been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning ’round and ’round as we bend the limits
Oh, it’s not unbreakable
Oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Push me, chase me, drive into the storm

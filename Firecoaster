Verse 1]
One, two, the night is igniting
Bright sparks are racing out on the street
I’m stepping to the crown
One, two, we just rise, rise, rise, two, we’re climbing from the embers
And the sky is breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone
To awaken all the fire in the hearts for the fight till the light is gone

[Chorus – unchanged]
It’s time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I’ve been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning ’round and ’round as we bend the limits
Oh, it’s not unbreakable

[Post-Chorus]
Push me, chase me, drive into the storm
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone
It’s not unbreakable

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, we run, and we run, and we run, till the light is gone
To awaken all the fire in the hearts for the fight till the light is gone

[Chorus – unchanged]
It’s time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I’ve been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning ’round and ’round as we bend the limits
Oh, it’s not unbreakable
Oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Push me, chase me, drive into the storm

[Verse 1]

Lost to our creation
a step towars damnation
out of reach
I'm about to wear the crown

out there, there is just no one to fear
deminished from the falling
the nature´s calling

[Pre-Chorus]
one to pretend that we tend our beating heart
awakened up as one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, we´re not unbreakable'

the time is here now

our own salvation cast into the wild.
one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn
it's not unbreakable


[Verse 2]
yeah
out here lost in fiction
lights all out upon our vision
remnants of the wild
just ride into the night

[Pre-Chorus]
so take this ride of your life on this beast to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

the time is here now
our own damnation left into the wild.
one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn
it's not unbreakable

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

break me
shake me
left into the wild
one to repent as we bend to the break of dawn
we´re not unbreakable

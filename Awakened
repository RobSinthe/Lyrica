The chains and ropes pull me under
it´s like i´m drowning in this maneating soul
thorn between the lies
drawn to realize another end to this same words of atrocity
i just can´t let it bleed
i need your guidence
let me see the

Fire inside your eyes
burning endlessly
a thousand tears aspire to underline
it´s time i´ll awake and raise my own fire

it´s time to let it go
as we cross the road
to the lies that has com to lead us astray
from our sanity
give me serenety
i need your guidance
let me see the

Fire inside your eyes
burning endlessly
a thousand tears aspire to underline
it´s time i´ll awake and take on what´s been hunting me

Fire inside your eyes
burning endlessly
a thousand tears aspire to underline
it´s time i´ll awake erasing what´s been hunting me

Fire inside your eyes
burning endlessly
a thousand tears aspire to underline
it´s time i´ll awake embrace my own fire

[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Carry a light a shade of a rising sun
Through the eye of the storm I run
I begin to feel my hearts unfold
as i witness this spoken prophesy
Foretelling the words of hypocrisy
The menace has just begun
For better or worse I'll be chasing the sun
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm on the run
i'm bound to cross the line
With every step that I take
[Chorus]
Into the fire
i See the stars in downfall as night turns to light
On enemy lines
Here I stand
In lust tyrannical
eradicate what is just in a shattered system all in downfall
Erase and rewind the fire of mine
In lust tyrannical
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
A dynasty
On enemy soil, I'm taking the lead
Let us just simplify 
the nature of this game i am feeling strong
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm on the run
i'm bound across the line
With every step that I take
[Chorus]
Into the fire
i See the stars in downfall as night turns to light
On enemy lines
Here I stand
In lust tyrannical
Eradicate what is just in a shattered system all in downfall
Erase and rewind the fire of mine
[Instrumental]
[verse 2]
Into the fire
See the stars in downfall and night turns to light
on enemy lines
Here I stand
In lust tyrannical
Eradicate what is just in a shattered ystem all in downfall
Erase and rewind the fire of mine
In lust tyrannical
[Instrumental]

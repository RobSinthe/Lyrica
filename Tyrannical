Tyrannical

Carry a light
a shade of a rising sun
through the eye of the storm i run
i begin to feel my heart unfold
as i witness the spoken prophesy
foretelling the words of hypocrisy
the menace has just begun
for better or worse
ill be chasing the sun
but I’m on the run

I’m bound to cross the line
with every step that i take

Come With me!
Into the fire
see the stars in downfall as night turns to light
behind enemy lines
here i stand
in lust tyrannical
eradicate what is just
in a shattered system
all in downfall
erase and rewind
the fire of mine
a lust tyrannical

a dynasty
on enemy soil
i´m taking the lead
let us just simplify the nature of this game
i am feeling strong
but I’m on the run

I’m bound to cross the line
with every step that i take

Into the fire
see the stars in downfall as night turns to light
behind enemy lines
here i stand
in lust tyrannical
Come!
eradicate what is just
in a shattered system
all in downfall
erase and rewind
the fire of mine
a lust tyrannical

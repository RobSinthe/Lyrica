[Verse 1]

caught in aberration
one step towars damnation on the street
I'm about to wear the crown

out there, there is just no one to fear
deminished from the falling
now nature´s calling

[Pre-Chorus]
one to defend as a fence to the break of dawn
a trail of dancing light in the night as we race to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, we´re not unbreakable'

its time to wake the bear now
revelation left into the wild
one to defend as a fence to the break of dawn
its not unbreakable


[Verse 2]
yeah
out here lost in fiction
lights all out upon our vision
remnants of the wild
just ride into the night

[Pre-Chorus]
so take this ride of your life on this beast to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

its time to wake the bear now
revelation left into the wild
one to defend as a fence to the break of dawn
its not unbreakable

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
it's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a fire coaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

break me
shake me
left into the wild
one to defend as a fence to the break of dawn
its not unbreakable

Verse 1
Through the gates of the night we ascend
Steel and thunder will carry the end
Every turn is a trial, every drop is a vow
In the chaos I’m fearless, and nothing can bow

Verse 2
In the blaze where the daylight won’t shine
I am bound to the beast in the line
Through the roar and the rush, I am breaking the chains
Every scream is a hymn in this blood-burning reign


choices we're given

Verse 1
Through the fire and glass I collide
Every heartbeat’s a drum as we ride
Every shadow erased in the flare of the light
I am chasing the edge of the night

Verse 2
With the wind tearing paths through my hair
I am lost to the pull of the dare
Every twist is a crown, every drop is the throne
And the storm writes my name into stone

If you’d like, I can also map out the syllable stresses for each line so you’re 100% sure they lock to your existing vocal rhythm before you track them.

Do you want me to do that for you?


Verse 1]
Through the haze, the skyline shimmers
Silver waves are bending in the heat
I’m standing where the clouds turn
From the fragments we are woven, through the silence we are drifting
And the stars are falling

In the glass, the night is breathing
Every sound is bending into gold
Our shadows turn to lanterns
From the echoes we are floating, through the mirrors we are shining
And the tides are calling

To awaken every dream with the spark in the dark till the light is gone

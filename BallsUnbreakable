so step on the ride of your life
as we race to the break of dawn...


its time to let us bring down the world
as minds are spinning, round and around in a firecoaster oh oh a force i been given 
like a wreckingball of faith i present
a new beginning, round and round as we bend the limits oh

it's not unbreakable

break me down
bend the limits
left into the wild

on thus ride of my life
as i face to the break of dawn...
my hearts unbreakable


light up the world in firecoaster



Verse 1
Through the gates of the night we ascend
Steel and thunder will carry the end
Every turn is a trial, every drop is a vow
In the chaos I’m fearless, and nothing can bow

Verse 2
In the blaze where the daylight won’t shine
I am bound to the beast in the line
Through the roar and the rush, I am breaking the chains
Every scream is a hymn in this blood-burning reign


choices we're given

Alternate Verse Set B – More Cinematic & Emotional

Verse 1
Through the fire and glass I collide
Every heartbeat’s a drum as we ride
Every shadow erased in the flare of the light
I am chasing the edge of the night

Verse 2
With the wind tearing paths through my hair
I am lost to the pull of the dare
Every twist is a crown, every drop is the throne
And the storm writes my name into stone

If you’d like, I can also map out the syllable stresses for each line so you’re 100% sure they lock to your existing vocal rhythm before you track them.

Do you want me to do that for you?

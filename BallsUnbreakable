so step on the ride of your life
on this beast to the break of dawn...
its time to let us bring down the walls
of controdiction, burn down your world in a firecoaster oh oh oh lets break the limit
like balls are spinning round an round
a new beginning, round and round as the balls are calling down. 

it's unforgivable, yeah
shake me
break me
left into the wild

im taking a ride of my life life
on this beast to the break of dawn...
we're all unbreakable


light up the world in firecoaster

[Verse 1]
One, two, generations
Let's see this revolution on the street
I'm about to wreck the crowd

One, two, that is just one
One, two, just finished from the falling
And the base is falling

[Pre-Chorus]
so step on the ride of your life as we race to the break of dawn
To awaken up them one with the fume to the fight to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
t's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable'

its time to bring them here now
revelation left into the wild
one to the ten to the fence of the break of dawn
its not unbreakable


[Verse 2]
yeah
one two tunnelvision
lights all out upon our vision
remnants of the wild
just ride into the night

[Pre-Chorus]
so take this ride of your life on this beast to the break of dawn

[Chorus]
t's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

its time to bring them here now
revelation left into the wild
one to the ten to the fence of the break of dawn
its not unbreakable

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
t's time to let us bring down the world as minds are spinning around and around in a firecoaster
A force I've been given like a wrecking ball of faith
I present a new beginning round and around as we bend the limits
Oh, it's not unbreakable

its time to bring them here now
revelation left into the wild
one to the ten to the fence of the break of dawn
its not unbreakable

Verse 1
Through the gates of the night we ascend
Steel and thunder will carry the end
Every turn is a trial, every drop is a vow
In the chaos I’m fearless, and nothing can bow

Verse 2
In the blaze where the daylight won’t shine
I am bound to the beast in the line
Through the roar and the rush, I am breaking the chains
Every scream is a hymn in this blood-burning reign

Alternate Verse Set B – More Cinematic & Emotional

Verse 1
Through the fire and glass I collide
Every heartbeat’s a drum as we ride
Every shadow erased in the flare of the light
I am chasing the edge of the night

Verse 2
With the wind tearing paths through my hair
I am lost to the pull of the dare
Every twist is a crown, every drop is the throne
And the storm writes my name into stone

If you’d like, I can also map out the syllable stresses for each line so you’re 100% sure they lock to your existing vocal rhythm before you track them.

Do you want me to do that for you?

Yours Endlessly

Verse 1:

Breathe in
fade out
let silence beat the vile 
as clouds of ravens falling
you’ll find a  peace in me  
like a blitz  of serenity 

in the eye of the storm
i´ll accumelate a force. of the north,  
as the power of yours,  ill stand there beside you

Bridge 1:
and show you the way out of here
when life flips the coin ill be there 

Chorus 1:
Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most.
I will be there and light up like the northern lights.
When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons,
I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.



Verse 2:

when your lost to the dark of infinity
like a tower of hope ill regenerate the spark in your heart as a light in the dark
a fiction of dust regenerated core

a voice incinerate
as the power of will i will generate the force of the north
and ill stand there beside you

Bridge 2:
and show you the way out of here
when shit hits the fan ill be there 

Chorus 2:

Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most.
I will be there and light up like the northern lights.
When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons,
I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.

Breakdown:

in the dark when all light is gone
and the light fade to lead us through the dark
has been faded to silence fall
in the dark when all light is gone
and the light fade to lead us through the dark
I’m yours

Breathe in
fade out
let silence beat the vile 
when clouds of ravens falling
you’ll find your peace in me  
like a blitz  of serenity 

through the fire and flames
i´ll accumelate a force. of the north,  
in the eye of the storm ill stand there beside you
and show you the way out of here
when life flips the coin ill be there


for better or worse im yours

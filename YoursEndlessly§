Yours Endlessly

Verse 1:

Breathe in
fade out
let silence beat the vile 
as clouds of ravens falling
you’ll find a  peace in me  
like a blitz  of serenity 

in the eye of the storm
i´ll accumelate a force. of the north,  
as the power of yours,  ill stand there beside you

Bridge 1:
and show you the way out of here
when life flips the coin ill be there 

Chorus 1:
Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most.
I will be there and light up like the northern lights.
When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons,
I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.



Verse 2:

when your lost to the dark of infinity
like a tower of hope ill regenerate the spark in your heart as a light in the dark
a fiction of dust regenerated core

a voice incinerate
as the power of will i will generate the force of the north
and ill stand there beside you

Bridge 2:
and show you the way out of here
when shit hits the fan ill be there 

Chorus 2:

Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most.
I will be there and light up like the northern lights.
When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons,
I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.

Breakdown:

in the dark when all light is gone
and the light fade to lead us through the dark
has been faded to silence fall
in the dark when all light is gone
and the light fade to lead us through the dark
I’m yours




Yours Endlessly
Verse 1:

Breathe in
Fade out
Let silence chase the pain
As wings of shadow gather
You'll find a calm in me
Like thunder held in mercy

In the eye of the storm
I’ll hold the line with the force of the north
As the power is yours — I’ll stand there beside you

Bridge 1:

and show you the way out of here
when life flips the coin I’ll be there

Chorus 1:

Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most.
I will be there and light up like the northern lights.
When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons,
I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.

Verse 2:

When you're lost to the dark of infinity
Like a tower of hope, I’ll rebuild what was burned
The spark in your chest — I will guard with my hands
A whisper of light drawn from shadows and sand

A voice to resonate
With the strength of your soul, I will carry the flame
And I’ll stand there beside you

Bridge 2:

and show you the way out of here
when shit hits the fan I’ll be there

Chorus 2:

Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most.
I will be there and light up like the northern lights.
When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons,
I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.

Breakdown:

In the dark when all light is gone
And the last star forgets where to shine
Let the quiet still hold us close

In the dark when all light is gone
And the last star forgets where to shine
I’m yours

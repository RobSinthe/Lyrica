Breathe in
fade out
let silence beat the vile 
when clouds of ravens falling
you’ll find your peace in me  
like a blitz  of serenity 

through the fire and flames
i´ll accumelate a force. of the north,  
in the eye of the storm ill stand there beside you
and show you the way out of here
when life flips the coin ill be there


for better or worse im yours
(solo)

snabba trioler under stämvändningarna


Yours Endlessly

Verse 1:

Breathe in
fade out
let silence beat the vile 
as clouds of ravens falling
you’ll find a   peace in me  
like a blitz  of serenity 

in the eye of the storm
i´ll accumelate a force. of the north,  
as the power of yours,  ill stand there beside you
and show you the way out of here
when life flips the coin ill be there 



verse 2:

when your lost to the dark of infinity
like a tower of hope ill regenerate the spark in your heart for the power will
a fiction of dust regenerated core

my voice incinerate

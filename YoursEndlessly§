Yours Endlessly

Verse 1:

Breathe in Fade out Let silence beat the vile As clouds of ravens falling Come find your peace in me Like a blitz of adrenaline
For the power of yours I’ll accumulate a force — of the Norse In the eye of the storm, I’ll stand there beside you

Bridge 1:
 And show you the way out of here When life flips the coin, I’ll be there

Chorus 1:
 Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most. I will be there and light up like the northern lights. When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons, I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.

Verse 2:

When you're lost to the dark of infinity As a flame, I'll combust And I’ll see you from the towers within Over mountains of sins A vision, perplex Eclipsing our fall My soul, incinerate With the power of will, a regenerated force of the Norse I’ll stand there beside you

Bridge 2: I’ll show you the way out of here When shit hits the fan, I’ll be there

Chorus 2: Raise your voice. Step up when you need it the most. I will be there and light up like the northern lights. When fire fills the void and crash down with a million tons, I am here. Through darkness and rain, yours endlessly.

Breakdown:
In the dark, when all light is gone And the beat of your heart keeps marching on I will be your serenity In the dark, when all light is gone As the beat of my heart goes ever on I’m yours

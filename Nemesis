Nemesis

Little child, can you see me cry
as the waves are pulling you deep before my eyes
and i see you cross the line

a rain of thorns edging deeper in me
now we tell by the cross that it´s  all to late
its slipping away

our time awaits
before you will ever see
we cannot bend for this wanted end
a nemesis (a memory)?
in dust we all dance away
sometime in our way

somewhere in time
could you see through my eyes 
and understand
there´s  no meaning at all to defy this 
await our lies to haunt us from this day


our time awaits
before you will ever see
we cannot bend for this wanted end
a nemesis
in dust we all dance away
and now you slip away

our eyes will never see you coming home
could we have changed it

our time awaits
before you will ever see
we cannot bend for this wanted end
a nemesis
in dust we all dance away
and now you slip away


lead the tidal append over me
i cannot saturate the one ascending
my powers on the edge of rain
you would rise to see it all

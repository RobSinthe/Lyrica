ARISE
LIKE SMOKE FROM A FIRE
OF ALL OF THE MEMORIES LEFT TO STAND THE TEST OF TIME
HERE I COME DETORIOUS BURNING THE BONES
OF A MIND DELETERIOUS OVER AND DONE
YET TOGETHER WE STAND TALL

A RISING SUN
ENLIGHTEN THE POWER WITHIN


RISE ABOVE IT ALL
ERUPT FROM THIS LIFE AS YOU BECOME 
A RISING SUN
YOU’RE THE ONE
ONE STEP AT A TIME I CLIMB 
IN MY DETERMINATION TO FIND
A PIECE OF MY NUMBER ONE (CHOSEN ONE)
YOU’RE THE ONE

I HEAR YOUR CALL
OUT IN THE THE DISTANS I SEE IT ALL
THE SANDS OF TIME WILL LEAD US ALL THE WAY

A RISING SUN
ENLIGHTEN THE POWER WITHIN

 
RISE ABOVE IT ALL
ERUPT FROM THIS LIFE AS YOU BECOME 
A RISING SUN
YOU’RE THE ONE
ONE STEP AT A TIME I CLIMB 
IN MY DETERMINATION TO FIND
A PIECE OF MY NUMBER ONE
A RISING SUN
YOU’RE THE ONE

OVER MOUNTAINS HIGH I LEARNED TO CRASH AND BURN
OVER SEVEN SEAS I FOUND YOUR HEART IN THE HAZE
OUT OF A PILE OF ASHES YOU ARISE 
ARISE ARISE

RISE ABOVE IT ALL
ERUPT FROM THIS LIFE AS YOU BECOME 
A RISING SUN
YOU’RE THE ONE
ONE STEP AT A TIME I CLIMB 
IN MY DETERMINATION TO FIND
A PIECE OF MY NUMBER ONE
A RISING SUN
YOU’RE THE ONE
